# Private Fonts
- This directory is a placeholder for fonts that are not available in the public domain (I get in legal trouble if I distribute them).
- To install private fonts, you must download them yourself and place them in this directory.
- Any .ttf files located in the directory will be installed. 
- Separating the fonts into their own directories is not strictly necessary, and is only done for granularity purposes.
  - font modules should be at most 1 level deep under this directory. i.e. `modules/fonts/paid/<font-name>/<font-files>.ttf`
